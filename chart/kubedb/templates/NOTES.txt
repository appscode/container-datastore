To verify that KubeDB has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get deployments -l "release={{ .Release.Name }}, app={{ template "kubedb.name" . }}"

If you have not installed appscode/kubedb-catalog chart, install it. If already installed, upgrade appscode/kubedb-catalog chart.
