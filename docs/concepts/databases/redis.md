# Redis

## What is Redis

`Redis` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [Redis](https://redis.io/) in a Kubernetes native way. You only need to describe the desired database configuration in a Redis object, and the KubeDB operator will create Kubernetes objects in the desired state for you.

## Redis Spec

As with all other Kubernetes objects, a Redis needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields. It also needs a `.spec` section. Below is an example Redis object.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Redis
metadata:
  name: r1
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 4
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 50Mi
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  doNotPause: true
  configSource:
      configMap:
        name: rd-custom-config
  env:
    - name:  MY_ENV
      value: "env-example"
  monitor:
    agent: coreos-prometheus-operator
    prometheus:
      namespace: demo
      labels:
        app: kubedb
      interval: 10s
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"
```

### spec.version

`spec.version` is a required field specifying the version of Redis database. Official [Redis docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/redis/tags/) will be used for the specific version.

### spec.storage

Since 0.8.0, `spec.storage` is a required field that specifies the StorageClass of PVCs dynamically allocated to store data for the database. This storage spec will be passed to the StatefulSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests.

- `spec.storage.storageClassName` is the name of the StorageClass used to provision PVCs. PVCs donâ€™t necessarily have to request a class. A PVC with its storageClassName set equal to "" is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to ""). A PVC with no storageClassName is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster depending on whether the DefaultStorageClass admission plugin is turned on.
- `spec.storage.accessModes` uses the same conventions as Kubernetes PVCs when requesting storage with specific access modes.
- `spec.storage.resources` can be used to request specific quantities of storage. This follows the same resource model used by PVCs.

To learn how to configure `spec.storage`, please visit the links below:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims

### spec.nodeSelector

`spec.nodeSelector` is an optional field that specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). To learn more, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) .

### spec.doNotPause

`spec.doNotPause` is an optional field that tells KubeDB operator that if this Redis object is deleted, whether it should be reverted automatically. This should be set to `true` for production databases to avoid accidental deletion. If not set or set to false, deleting a Redis object put the database into a dormant state. The StatefulSet for a DormantDatabase is deleted but the underlying PVCs are left intact. This allows user to resume the database later.

### spec.imagePullSecret

`KubeDB` provides the flexibility of deploying Redis database from a private Docker registry. To learn how to deploy Redis from a private registry, please visit [here](/docs/guides/redis/private-registry/using-private-registry.md).

### spec.configSource

`spec.configSource` is an optional field that allows users to provide custom configuration for Redis. This field accepts a [`VolumeSource`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.11/core/v1/types.go#L47). So you can use any kubernetes supported volume source such as `configMap`, `secret`, `azureDisk` etc. To learn more about how to use a custom configuration file see [here](/docs/guides/redis/custom-config/using-custom-config.md).

### spec.env

`spec.env` is an optional field that specifies the environment variables to pass to the Redis docker image.

Note that, Kubedb does not allow to update the environment variables. If you try to update environment variables, Kubedb operator will reject the request with following error,

```ini
Error from server (BadRequest): error when applying patch:
...
for: "./redis.yaml": admission webhook "redis.validators.kubedb.com" denied the request: precondition failed for:
...
At least one of the following was changed:
	apiVersion
	kind
	name
	namespace
	spec.version
	spec.storage
	spec.nodeSelector
	spec.env
```

### spec.monitor

Redis managed by KubeDB can be monitored with builtin-Prometheus and CoreOS-Prometheus operator out-of-the-box. To learn more,

- [Monitor Redis with builtin Prometheus](/docs/guides/redis/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md)
- [Monitor Redis with CoreOS Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/redis/monitoring/using-coreos-prometheus-operator.md)

### spec.resources

`spec.resources` is an optional field. This can be used to request compute resources required by the database pods. To learn more, visit [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/).
